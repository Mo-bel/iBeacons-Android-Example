iBeacons-Android-Example
========================
A showcase on how to setup an iBeacon on an iOS device, and how to monitor them. This simple app demonstrates simple beacom discovery and the use of the Radius Open Source lib.

This example was used during the Mobel meetup hackathon on NFC and iBeacons to show how beacons work on Android.
